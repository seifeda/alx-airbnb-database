-- ============================================================

-- 1️⃣ Aggregation: Total number of bookings made by each user
SELECT
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    COUNT(b.booking_id) AS total_bookings
FROM User u
    LEFT JOIN Booking b ON u.user_id = b.user_id
GROUP BY u.user_id, u.first_name, u.last_name
ORDER BY total_bookings DESC;


-- 2️⃣ Window Function: Rank properties based on total number of bookings received
SELECT
    p.property_id,
    p.name AS property_name,
    COUNT(b.booking_id) AS total_bookings,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(b.booking_id) DESC) AS booking_rank
FROM Property p
    LEFT JOIN Booking b ON p.property_id = b.property_id
GROUP BY p.property_id, p.name
ORDER BY booking_rank;
